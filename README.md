## Description

Iâ€™m redesigning Arngren.net, an online marketplace that currently has a cluttered and outdated design. The site features a wide range of products, but its navigation is confusing and difficult to use. The new site will have a cleaner, more organized layout, with better categorization of products, improved search functionality, and a more modern look to enhance the user experience and make it easier for customers to find and purchase items.

## Target Audience

- **Primary:** Tech-savvy individuals aged 18-35 who seek the latest gadgets, smart home devices, and e-mobility products. They are early adopters who value innovation, seamless shopping, and high-performance technology. Their buying decisions are influenced by reviews, social media trends, and product specs.
  
- **Secondary:** Professionals and tech enthusiasts aged 36-45 who prioritize reliability, brand reputation, and long-term value. They seek premium electronics, smart automation, and efficient transportation solutions, focusing on practicality and customer support over the latest trends.

## Project Goals

- Showcase a wide range of electronics, gadgets, and transportation products.
- Provide an intuitive and efficient browsing experience with well-organized categories.
- Offer a responsive and fast-loading website for smooth navigation.
- Optimize for mobile and desktop users for a seamless experience.
- Highlight product features, specifications, and benefits to assist in decision-making.
