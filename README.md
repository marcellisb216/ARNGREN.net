## Description

Iâ€™m redesigning Arngren.net, an online marketplace that currently has a cluttered and outdated design. The site features a wide range of products, but its navigation is confusing and difficult to use. The new site will have a cleaner, more organized layout, with better categorization of products, improved search functionality, and a more modern look to enhance the user experience and make it easier for customers to find and purchase items.

Additionally, the redesign will prioritize mobile responsiveness, ensuring a seamless shopping experience across all devices. A more intuitive interface will replace the current chaotic structure, featuring clear menus, visually appealing product displays, and a streamlined checkout process. Enhanced filtering options and smart recommendations will help users quickly discover relevant products. The goal is to transform Arngren.net into a user-friendly, visually engaging, and efficient marketplace that meets the expectations of modern online shoppers.
